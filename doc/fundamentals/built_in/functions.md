# Built-In Functions

## len

The `len` function returns the length of various types in Go, including [arrays](../composite/array.md#array), [slices](../composite/slice.md#slice), [maps](../composite/maps.md#maps), [strings](../literals/strings.md#strings), and [channels](../../multithreading/channels.md#channels). For arrays, slices, and strings, it returns the number of elements or bytes, while for maps, it returns the number of key-value pairs. For channels, it returns the number of elements currently in the channel buffer.
