A particular but not private repository to centralize all studies about Go and a few famous Go's libraries. It's kind my own documentation about the language. :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

## Go's Paradigms and Characteristics

Go aims to be both **`simple and powerful`**, with the goal of enhancing programmers' productivity. It boasts a straightforward and consistent syntax that remains stable across versions, ensuring **`compatibility`**. One of Go's standout features is its robust support for **`concurrency`**. It is designed to efficiently leverage multicore processors and excel in handling network-related tasks. In terms of typing, Go follows a **`static and strong typing system`**. Here are some key aspects of Go's paradigms and its way of work:

??? info "Imperative Programming"
    Go follows an imperative programming paradigm, where programs are composed of statements that change a program's state. Imperative programming is characterized by its focus on describing how a program operates by specifying a sequence of commands.

??? info "Procedural Programming"
    Go supports procedural programming, where programs are organized into procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. Procedural programming emphasizes the use of procedures for code organization and reusability.

??? info "Structured Programming"
    Structured programming promotes the use of structured control flow constructs like loops and conditionals to improve code readability and maintainability. Go encourages structured programming through its syntax and built-in control flow mechanisms.

??? info "Concurrent Programming"
    One of Go's key characteristics is its strong support for concurrent programming. Go provides built-in primitives such as goroutines and channels for concurrent execution, making it easier to write efficient and scalable concurrent programs.

??? info "Functional Programming"
    While Go is not a purely functional programming language, it incorporates some functional programming concepts such as first-class functions, closures, and immutability. These features enable functional programming patterns in Go code, allowing developers to write concise and expressive programs.

??? info "Static and Strong Typing"
    Go is statically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at compile time and cannot change during runtime. Go is statically typed, which means that variable types are known at compile time and cannot change during program execution. This allows the compiler to perform type checking and catch type-related errors before the program runs, leading to more robust and predictable behavior.

??? info "Minimalism"
    Go follows a minimalist design philosophy, favoring simplicity and readability over complexity. The language specification and standard library are intentionally kept small to reduce cognitive overhead and make it easier for developers to learn and understand the language.

??? info "Compiled Language"
    Go is a compiled language, meaning that source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution. Compiled languages typically offer better performance and efficiency compared to interpreted languages.

??? info "Efficiency"
    Go prioritizes efficiency in terms of both execution speed and resource usage. The language is designed to compile quickly and produce binaries that are lightweight and fast, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, including web servers, microservices, and system-level programming.
